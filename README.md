## 1. what is Angular? Why do we need it?

- Angular is a frontend javascript binding framework which binds the view(HTML UI) and model(javascript).
- It helpes us to reduce the effort to write the lengthy lines of code for binding.
- It also helps to build the Single Page Application(SPA) using the concept of routing.
- Angular has some other cool things too, like handling data from the internet using HTTP, organizing code neatly using Dependency Injection/DI, data binding, forms and validations, communicating between two components using Input and Output etc.
